This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# State Management Samples

In the spirit of learning and knowledge sharing, I put together sample set of using different front end state management strategies to accomplish some of the same goals.  The first two strategies implemented are purely React using `useState` for local and `useContext` for global state management.  The next rest of the project is make up of different front end state management libraries including Redux and XState.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can experience the different state management strategies in each of the following paths:

* `/local`
* `/global`
* `/redux`
* `/xstate`

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
